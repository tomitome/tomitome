## 🔬 About Me
I am a graduate student at **Kyushu Institute of Technology**, working on the **electronic structure and transport properties** of low-dimensional thermoelectric materials.  
My research focuses on the *one-dimensional tellurides* **M₄SiTe₄ (M = Ta, Nb)**, exploring how band topology, spin–orbit coupling, and carrier concentration interplay to enhance thermoelectric performance.

## 📘 Featured Publication
### **Optimal Carrier Concentration of Low-Temperature Thermoelectric Material M₄SiTe₄ (M = Ta, Nb)**  
*Journal of the Physical Society of Japan (2025)* — [Link to paper](https://journals.jps.jp/doi/full/10.7566/JPSJ.94.114705)


- Demonstrated accurate **first-principles predictions of Seebeck coefficient & Hall carrier concentration**.  
- Revealed that **optimal ZT occurs at ~10²⁰–10²¹ cm⁻³** for both n- and p-type systems.  
- Showed that **p-type M₄SiTe₄ is not yet experimentally optimized** — higher carrier concentration can further boost ZT.  
- Combined **DFT (VASP / QE)**, **Boltzmann transport calculations (BoltzTraP2)**, and **phonon calculations (ALAMODE)** for a full thermoelectric analysis.

## 🔥 Highlight — Key Result from My Paper
> **ZT is maximized when μ slightly overlaps the band edge**, typically at  
> **10²⁰–10²¹ cm⁻³**,  
> demonstrating that both Ta₄SiTe₄ and Nb₄SiTe₄ benefit from a band structure nearly symmetric with respect to EF.  
>
> **p-type samples have room for improvement** — tuning carrier concentration can significantly enhance performance.
